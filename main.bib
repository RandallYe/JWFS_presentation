It is based on ranking supermartingales, a notion analogous to ranking functions on non-probabilistic programs. The framework is proven sound and complete for a meaningful class of programs involving randomization and bounded nondeterminism. We complement this foundational insigh by a practical proof methodology, based on sound conditions that enable compositional reasoning and are amenable to a direct implementation using modern theorem provers. This is integrated in a small dependent type system, to overcome the problem that lexicographic ranking functions fail when combined with randomization. Among others, this compositional methodology enables the verification of probabilistic programs outside the complete class that admits ranking supermartingales.},

  abstract  = {Semantics for nondeterministic probabilistic sequential programs has been well studied in the past decades. In a variety of semantic models, how nondeterministic choice interacts with probabilistic choice is the most significant difference. In He, Morgan, and McIver's relational model, probabilistic choice refines nondeterministic choice. This model is general because of its predicative-style semantics in Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming, and suitable for automated reasoning because of its algebraic feature. Previously, we gave probabilistic semantics to the RoboChart notation based on this model, and also formalised the proof that the semantic embedding is a homomorphism, and revealed interesting details. In this paper, we present our mechanisation of the proof in Isabelle/UTP enabling automated reasoning for probabilistic sequential programs including a subset of the RoboChart language. With mechanisation, we even reveal more interesting questions, hidden in the original model. We demonstrate several examples, including an example to illustrate the interaction between nondeterministic choice and probabilistic choice, and a RoboChart model for randomisation based on binary probabilistic choice.},

  abstract = {The growing complexity and diversity of models used for engineering dependable systems implies that a variety of formal methods, across differing abstractions, paradigms, and presentations, must be integrated. Such an integration requires unified semantic foundations for the various notations, and co-ordination of a variety of automated verification tools. The contribution of this paper is Isabelle/UTP, an implementation of Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming, a framework for unification of formal semantics. Isabelle/UTP permits the mechanisation of computational theories for diverse paradigms, and their use in constructing formalised semantics. These can be further applied in the development of verification tools, harnessing Isabelle's proof automation facilities. Several layers of mathematical foundations are developed, including lenses to model variables and state spaces as algebraic objects, alphabetised predicates and relations to model programs, algebraic and axiomatic semantics, proof tools for Hoare logic and refinement calculus, and UTP theories to encode computational paradigms.},

  abstract  = {We outline a probabilistic denotational semantics for the RoboChart language, a diagrammatic, domain-specific notation for describing robotic controllers with their hardware platforms and operating environments. We do this using a powerful (but perhaps not so well known) semantic technique: He, Morgan, and McIver's weakest completion semantics, which is based on Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming. In this approach, we do the following: (1) start with the standard semantics for a nondeterministic programming language; (2) propose a new probabilistic semantic domain; (3) propose a forgetful function from the probabilistic semantic domain to the standard semantic domain; (4) use the converse of the forgetful function to embed the standard semantic domain in the probabilistic semantic domain; (5) demonstrate that this embedding preserves program structure; (6) define the probabilistic choice operator. Weakest completion semantics guides the semantic definition of new languages by building on existing semantics and, in this case, tackling a notoriously thorny issue: the relationship between demonic and probabilistic choice. Consistency ensures that programming intuitions, development techniques, and proof methods can be carried over from the standard language to the probabilistic one. We largely follow He et al., our contribution being an explication of the technique with meticulous proofs suitable for mechanisation in Isabelle/UTP.},

  abstract = {This paper presents two complementary but equivalent semantics for a high level probabilistic programming language. One of these interprets programs as partial measurable functions on a measurable space. The other interprets programs as continuous linear operators on a Banach space of measures. It is shown how the ordered domains of Scott and others are embedded naturally into these spaces. We use the semantics to prove a general result about probabilistic programs, namely, that a program's behavior is completely determined by its action on fixed inputs.},

The extended language has an additional operator, namely probabilistic choice, which makes it possible to express randomized algorithms. An earlier model by Claire Jones included probabilistic choice but not non-determinism, which meant that it could not be used for the development of algorithms from specifications. Our second model is built on top of Claire Jones' model, using a general method of extending a probabilistic cpo to one which also contains non-determinism. The first model was constructed from scratch, as it were, guided only by the desire for certain algebraic properties of the language constructs, which we found lacking in the second model. We compare and contrast the properties of the two models both by giving examples and by constructing mappings between them and the non-probabilistic model. On the basis of this comparison we argue that, in general, the first model is preferable to the second.},

Parametric Markov decision processes whose state rewards depend on the post-expectation at hand are used as the operational model. We show that the weakest pre-expectation of a pGCL-program w.r.t. a post-expectation corresponds to the expected cumulative reward to reach a terminal state in the parametric MDP associated to the program. In a similar way, we show a correspondence between weakest liberal pre-expectations and liberal expected cumulative rewards. The verification of probabilistic programs using wp-semantics and operational semantics is illustrated using a simple running example.},

We study a formalism which allows reasoning about programs which can act probabilistically. To describe probabilistic programs a basic programming language with an operator for probabilistic choice is introduced and a denotational semantics is given for this language. To specify properties of probabilistic programs, standard first order logic predicates are insufficient, so a notion of probabilistic predicates are introduced. A Hoare-style proof system to check properties of probabilistic programs is given. The proof system for a sublanguage is shown to be correct and complete; the properties that can be derived are exactly the valid properties. Finally some typical examples illustrate the use of the probabilistic predicates and the proof system.},

An important question for a probabilistic program is whether the probability mass of all its diverging runs is zero, that is that it terminates "almost surely". Proving that can be hard, and this paper presents a new method for doing so. It applies directly to the program's source code, even if the program contains demonic choice. Like others, we use variant functions (a.k.a. "super-martingales") that are real-valued and decrease randomly on each loop iteration; but our key innovation is that the amount as well as the probability of the decrease are parametric. We prove the soundness of the new rule, indicate where its applicability goes beyond existing rules, and explain its connection to classical results on denumerable (non-demonic) Markov chains.},

  abstract   = {Probabilistic programs extend classical imperative programs with real-valued random variables and random branching. The most basic liveness property for such programs is the termination property. The qualitative (aka almost-sure) termination problem asks whether a given program program terminates with probability 1. While ranking functions provide a sound and complete method for non-probabilistic programs, the extension of them to probabilistic programs is achieved via ranking supermartingales (RSMs). Although deep theoretical results have been established about RSMs, their application to probabilistic programs with nondeterminism has been limited only to programs of restricted control-flow structure. For non-probabilistic programs, lexicographic ranking functions provide a compositional and practical approach for termination analysis of real-world programs. In this work we introduce lexicographic RSMs and show that they present a sound method for almost-sure termination of probabilistic programs with nondeterminism. We show that lexicographic RSMs provide a tool for compositional reasoning about almost-sure termination, and for probabilistic programs with linear arithmetic they can be synthesized efficiently (in polynomial time). We also show that with additional restrictions even asymptotic bounds on expected termination time can be obtained through lexicographic RSMs. Finally, we present experimental results on benchmarks adapted from previous work to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

Whereas, traditional program analysis uses Floyd-Hoare style invariants to over-approximate the set of reachable states, our approach synthesizes invariant inequalities involving the expected values of program expressions at the loop head. We first define the notion of expectation invariants, and demonstrate their usefulness in analyzing probabilistic program loops. Next, we present the set of expectation invariants for a loop as a fixed point of the pre-expectation operator over sets of program expressions. Finally, we use existing concepts from abstract interpretation theory to present an iterative analysis that synthesizes expectation invariants for probabilistic program loops. We show how the standard polyhedral abstract domain can be used to synthesize expectation invariants for probabilistic programs, and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on some examples of probabilistic program loops.},

  abstract   = {In this article, we consider the termination problem of probabilistic programs with real-valued variables. The questions concerned are: qualitative ones that ask (i) whether the program terminates with probability 1 (almost-sure termination) and (ii) whether the expected termination time is finite (finite termination); and quantitative ones that ask (i) to approximate the expected termination time (expectation problem) and (ii) to compute a bound B such that the probability not to terminate after B steps decreases exponentially (concentration problem). To solve these questions, we utilize the notion of ranking supermartingales, which is a powerful approach for proving termination of probabilistic programs. In detail, we focus on algorithmic synthesis of linear ranking-supermartingales over affine probabilistic programs (Apps) with both angelic and demonic non-determinism. An important subclass of Apps is LRApp which is defined as the class of all Apps over which a linear ranking-supermartingale exists.Our main contributions are as follows. Firstly, we show that the membership problem of LRApp (i) can be decided in polynomial time for Apps with at most demonic non-determinism, and (ii) is NP-hard and in PSPACE for Apps with angelic non-determinism. Moreover, the NP-hardness result holds already for Apps without probability and demonic non-determinism. Secondly, we show that the concentration problem over LRApp can be solved in the same complexity as for the membership problem of LRApp. Finally, we show that the expectation problem over LRApp can be solved in 2EXPTIME and is PSPACE-hard even for Apps without probability and non-determinism (i.e., deterministic programs). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to answer the qualitative and quantitative questions over Apps with at most demonic non-determinism.},

An advantage of using the general construction is that it is easy to see which CSP identities remain true in the probabilistic model. A surprising consequence however is that probabilistic choice distributes through all other operators; such algebraic mobility means that the syntactic position of the choice operator gives little information about when the choice actually must occur. That in turn leads to some interesting interaction between probability and nondeterminism.A simple communications protocol is used to illustrate the probabilistic algebra, and several suggestions are made for accommodating and controlling nondeterminism when probability is present.},

  abstract  = {Extending Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) by preserving the distributivity laws for internal choice, in the presence of probabilistic choice, has been an open problem so far. The problem stems from a well known disagreement between probabilistic choice and nondeterministic choice, that raises congruence issues for parallel composition. Recently, it has been argued that the congruence issue can be resolved only by restricting the power of the schedulers that resolve the nondeterminism. In our previous work, we have restricted the schedulers by suitably labeling the nondeterministic transitions. We have defined a ready-trace equivalence and a parallel composition with hiding for which the equivalence is a congruence. In this paper, we generalize our model and give a CSP-style axiomatic characterization of the ready-trace equivalence. From the axiomatization it follows that all distributivity axioms for internal choice from CSP are preserved, and no new axioms are added.},

These models are investigated within the context of PCCS, an extension of Milner′s SCCS in which each summand of a process summation expression is guarded by a probability and the sum of these probabilities is 1. For each model, we present a structural operational semantics of PCCS and a notion of bisimulation equivalence which we prove to be a congruence. We also show that the models form a hierarchy: the reactive model is derivable from the generative model by abstraction from the relative probabilities of different actions, and the generative model is derivable from the stratified model by abstraction from the purely probabilistic branching structure. Moreover, the classical nonprobabilistic model is derivable from each of these models by abstraction from all probabilities.},

  abstract  = {Every day we witness the fast development of the hardware and software technology. This, of course, is the reason that new and more complex systems controlled by some kind of computational-based devices become an unseparated part of our daily life. As more as the system complexity increases, as more the reasoning about its correct behaviour becomes dif??cult. A variety of consequences may occur as a result of a failure, ranging from simple annoying to life threatening ones. Thus for some systems it is crucial that they exhibit a correct functioning. However, for systems with an extremely complex construction it is almost impossible to give an absolute guarantee for their correctness. In this case, it is still satisfactory to know that the possibility for a system to fail is low enough. Formal methods have been developed for establishing correctness of computer systems. They provide rigorous methods with which one can formally specify properties of a systems's intended behaviour, and also can check if the system conforms to that speci??cation. In case of complex systems we need a formal method that allows us to reason in compositional way, it provides us with techniques that can be used to build larger systems from the composition of smaller ones. Process algebra carries exactly this idea; it provides operators that allow to compose processes in order to obtain a more complex process. Besides, every process algebra contains a set of axioms. Every axiom is an algebraic equation that carries our intuition and insight in process behaviour, it expresses which two processes behaviour we consider equal. In such a way, manipulation with processes becomes manipulation with equations in the algebraic sense. But, equations and operators do not have any meaning unless we place them in a certain real ¿world¿ and match the terms of the process algebra with the entities of the real world. This step is traditionally called ¿giving a semantic of the syntax¿. The structure constructed in this way is called a model of the considered process algebra. For every given process algebra we can construct an in??nite number of models, but only several of them are interesting for the purpose process algebra was developed as a formal method. However, there is a tendency always to use so-called a bisimulation model. In this thesis we propose several process algebras and construct their models based on the notion of bisimulation.},

In this chapter, we adopt Probabilistic Transition Systems as a basic model for probabilistic processes, in which probabilistic and nondeterministic choices are independent concepts. The model is essentially a nondeterministic version of Markov decision processes or probabilistic automata of Rabin. We develop a general framework to define probabilistic process languages to describe probabilistic transition systems. In particular, we show how operators for nonprobabilistic process algebras can be lifted to probabilistic process algebras in a uniform way similar to de Simone format. To establish a notion of refinement, we present a family of preorders including probabilistic bisimulation and simulation, and probabilistic testing pre-orders as well as their logical or denotational characterization. These preorders are shown to be precongruences with respect to the algebraic operators that can be defined in our general framework. Finally, we give a short account of the important work on extending the successful field of model checking to probabilistic settings and a brief discussion on current research in the area.},

  abstract = {Quantitative model checking and performance evaluation deal with the analysis of complex systems that must not only satisfy correctness requirements, but also meet performance and reliability goals. Models of such systems therefore need to represent the necessary quantitative information about probabilistic decisions, real-time phenomena, or continuous dynamics. At the same time, nondeterminism needs to be properly captured as in classical verification, so as to enable abstraction and compositional modelling. These aspects span a large spectrum of automata-based quantitative models which have been studied in the verification and performance evaluation literature. In this paper, we embark on a guided tour through this zoo of quantitative models. Starting from the basic formalisms of labelled transition systems and also Markov chains, we look at how timed and hybrid automata add real-time aspects as well as continuous dynamics, and we study extensions that provide for behaviour governed by discrete and continuous probability distributions. For each of the automata models, we outline its definition, provide a small illustrative example, summarise its expressive power, and survey available formal analysis techniques as well as selected practical applications.},

The two spaces give rise to two sublanguages, each of which is characterised by an algebraic axiomatisation which is shown to be sound and complete for finite processes. In the first semantics, processes are defined as probability measures on the space of infinite traces and operators are defined as functions (mostly transformations) of probability measures. The advantage of this semantics is that it is simple and good for reasoning about probabilistic properties such as self-stabilisation or fairness of random algorithms. The disadvantage is that neither external choice nor parallel composition other than fully synchronised parallel composition can be defined in this semantics. This problem is solved in the second model which is based on the space of conditional probability measures of infinite traces. This model leads to a set of proof rules for the deterministic properties of probabilistic algorithms, but it is more difficult to use in the analysis of probabilistic properties. The last part of the paper shows how the two models are related and how this can be exploited to combine their advantages and get around their disadvantages. This is illustrated by the example of a self-stabilising tokenring.},

The work in this paper presents formal verification of the most important safety functions of a high voltage controller. The controller has been modelled as a finite state machine, which was formally verified using two different model checking software tools; Simulink Design Verifier and RoboTool. Five safety critical properties were specified and formally verified using the two tools. Simulink was chosen as a low-threshold entry point since MathWorks products are well known to most practitioners. RoboTool serves as a software tool targeted towards model checking, thus providing more advanced options for the more experienced user. The comparative study and results show that all properties were successfully verified. The verification times in both tools were in the order of a few minutes, which was within the acceptable time limit for this particular application.},

Game-based techniques provide a popular approach in which proofs are structured as sequences of games and in which proof steps establish the validity of transitions between successive games. Code-based techniques form an instance of this approach that takes a code-centric view of games, and that relies on programming language theory to justify proof steps. While code-based techniques contribute to formalize the security statements precisely and to carry out proofs systematically, typical proofs are so long and involved that formal verification is necessary to achieve a high degree of confidence. We present Certicrypt, a framework that enables the machine-checked construction and verification of code-based proofs. Certicrypt is built upon the general-purpose proof assistant Coq, and draws on many areas, including probability, complexity, algebra, and semantics of programming languages. Certicrypt provides certified tools to reason about the equivalence of probabilistic programs, including a relational Hoare logic, a theory of observational equivalence, verified program transformations, and game-based techniques such as reasoning about failure events. The usefulness of Certicrypt is demonstrated through various examples, including a proof of semantic security of OAEP (with a bound that improves upon existing published results), and a proof of existential unforgeability of FDH signatures. Our work provides a first yet significant step towards Halevi's ambitious programme of providing tool support for cryptographic proofs.},

  abstract   = {Several probabilistic simulation relations for probabili stic systems are defined and evaluated according to two criteria: compositionality and preservation of "interesting" properties. Here, the interesting properties of a system are identified with those that are expressible in an untimed version of the Timed Probabilistic concurrent Computation Tree Logic (TPCTL) of Hansson. The definitions are made, and the evaluations carried out, in terms of a general labeled transition system model for concurrent probabilistic computation. The results cover weak simulations, which abstract from internal computation, as well as strong simulations, which do not},

In the first part of the paper we describe the deterministic language and its semantic model. The syntax is based upon that of timed CSP except some of the operators are refined so as to remove all nondeterminism; this produces prioritized operators. The semantics for our language represents a process as the set of possible behaviours for the process, where a behaviour models the priorities for different actions. A number of algebraic laws for our language are given and the model is illustrated with two examples. In the second part of the paper, we extend the language by adding a probabilistic choice operator. We produce a semantic model for our language which gives the probabilities of different behaviours occurring, as well as modelling the relative priorities for events within a behaviour. The model is illustrated with an example of a communications protocol transmitting messages over an unreliable medium.},

Its application includes determining the (possibly infinite) expected termination time of a randomized algorithm and proving positive almost--sure termination—does a program terminate with probability one in finite expected time? We provide several proof rules for bounding the runtime of loops, and prove the soundness of the approach with respect to a simple operational model. We show that our approach is a conservative extension of Nielson’s approach for reasoning about the runtime of deterministic programs. We analyze the expected runtime of some example programs including the coupon collector’s problem, a one--dimensional random walk and a randomized binary search.},

  abstract = {RoboChart is a core notation in the RoboStar framework. It is a timed and probabilistic domain-specific and state machine-based language for robotics. RoboChart supports shared variables and communication across entities in its component model. It has formal denotational semantics given in CSP. The semantic technique of Interaction Trees (ITrees) represents behaviours of reactive and concurrent programs interacting with their environments. Recent mechanisation of ITrees, ITree-based CSP semantics and a Z mathematical toolkit in Isabelle/HOL bring new applications of verification and animation for state-rich process languages, such as RoboChart. In this paper, we use ITrees to give RoboChart novel operational semantics, implement it in Isabelle, and use Isabelle's code generator to generate verified and executable animations. We illustrate our approach using an autonomous chemical detector and patrol robot models, exhibiting nondeterminism and using shared variables. With animation, we show two concrete scenarios for the chemical detector when the robot encounters different environmental inputs and three for the patrol robot when its calibrated position is in other corridor sections. We also verify that the animated scenarios are trace refinements of the CSP denotational semantics of the RoboChart models using FDR, a refinement model checker for CSP. This ensures that our approach to resolve nondeterminism using CSP operators with priority is sound and correct.},

abstract = {Interaction trees (ITrees) are a general-purpose data structure for representing the behaviors of recursive programs that interact with their environments. A coinductive variant of “free monads,” ITrees are built out of uninterpreted events and their continuations. They support compositional construction of interpreters from event handlers, which give meaning to events by defining their semantics as monadic actions. ITrees are expressive enough to represent impure and potentially nonterminating, mutually recursive computations, while admitting a rich equational theory of equivalence up to weak bisimulation. In contrast to other approaches such as relationally specified operational semantics, ITrees are executable via code extraction, making them suitable for debugging, testing, and implementing software artifacts that are amenable to formal verification. We have implemented ITrees and their associated theory as a Coq library, mechanizing classic domain- and category-theoretic results about program semantics, iteration, monadic structures, and equational reasoning. Although the internals of the library rely heavily on coinductive proofs, the interface hides these details so that clients can use and reason about ITrees without explicit use of Coq’s coinduction tactics. To showcase the utility of our theory, we prove the termination-sensitive correctness of a compiler from a simple imperative source language to an assembly-like target whose meanings are given in an ITree-based denotational semantics. Unlike previous results using operational techniques, our bisimulation proof follows straightforwardly by structural induction and elementary rewriting via an equational theory of combinators for control-flow graphs.},

Probabilistic model checking is a systematic way of analyzing finite-state probabilistic models. Existing probabilistic model checkers have been designed for simple systems without hierarchy. In this paper, we extend the PAT toolkit to support probabilistic model checking of hierarchical complex systems. We propose to use PCSP{\#}, a combination of Hoare's CSP with data and probability, to model such systems. In addition to temporal logic, we allow complex safety properties to be specified by non-probabilistic PCSP{\#} model. Validity of the properties (with probability) is established by refinement checking. Furthermore, we show that refinement checking can be applied to verify probabilistic systems against safety/co-safety temporal logic properties efficiently. We demonstrate the usability and scalability of the extended PAT checker via automated verification of benchmark systems and comparison with state-of-art probabilistic model checkers.},

Current practice of system analysis is, however, deficient under fairness. In this work, we present PAT, a toolkit for flexible and efficient system analysis under fairness. A unified algorithm is proposed to model check systems with a variety of fairness effectively in two different settings. Empirical evaluation shows that PAT complements existing model checkers in terms of fairness. We report that previously unknown bugs have been revealed using PAT against systems functioning under strong global fairness.},
